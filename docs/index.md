# Introduction

[Use this template :material-github:](https://github.com/new?template_name=disbot&template_owner=GriceTurrble){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

**DisBot** is a simple template for a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot
using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

You can use the template and this documentation together to learn more about
making your own Discord bot that responds to Slash Commands:

![The test bot responding to /hello slash command](imgs/example-disbot-hello.png)

...or prefixed commands:

![The test bot responding to !whatsup command](imgs/example-disbot-whatsup.png)

Ready to [get started](getting_started.md) setting up the bot?

Or you can [explore](explore.md) the fine details.

## About the author

:wave: I'm [GriceTurrble](https://github.com/griceturrble),
a software developer who's been working with Python since 2014.
I am occasionally active on [Python Discord](https://www.pythondiscord.com/)
where I offer advice and bad jokes to newcomers to the language
and to programming in general.

I am no expert in Discord bots or the discord.py package in particular,
but I love teaching folks new things.
I wrote this small template and its documentation from scratch,
both to expand my own knowledge about it
and, hopefully, to share those learnings with others.
